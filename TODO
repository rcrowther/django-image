How does cloud storage generate reforms?
Images Admin not removing files (do last)
Does auto delete work? (Partly)
auto_delete tests
Django is checking filename length

== Images
Transactional removal works?


== Reforms


== Filters
For cloud, what do you get to make reforms? so what source goes into the filter?
Register, want an instance? Admin want Model?

x 'Not found' and 'watermark' files on URLs? Makes them static files? !Test

== Admin

== Tags
Can title be part of general tag? No...


== Utils



== Settings
Cache filefinding, and the like


== Widgets
Make no_data_message on RemoteControlWidget an attribute too
No mark_safe in RemoteControlWidget?
D&D wiget not work with prepopulattion--a click on the label fixes that?

== Forms
Prepopulate in other forms
 #! throws a dependency error on change files


Foreign key model
Add shows unwanted selector, add and edit icons
: just a picker, please, for a new
Change is worse, shows the same pick, add and edit icons
:Either 'form in form', or 'edit the image file' button. Or both.

What it needs to do is save the new image, the go on to create the model into which it is embedded.


== embedded
    def get_formset(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):


_changeform_view
_create_formsets
get_formsets_with_inlines

# get fields is only sub
_get_form_for_get_fields


modelformset_factory too
This is the add.change form in admin.options


However, this is an issue, it uses the (non-existing) fk,
BaseInlineFormSet

forms.models.inlineformset_factory
modelformset_factory
Can do it all without fk, which is presed in at the end?


forms.models._get_foreign_key
: looks for key from model to parent???
parent Article
model image



== Model Field
on_delete underride not acknowledged - Look in Field

== Widget
Since when was Mozilla file browser D&D?
- How to test?
Some of the hover drop effects not working, why?

but ''change' is the horrible mess of ''choose' and ''add'
Try test for writability of ''files'


= Tests
For filter format (size)?


= General
STATIC_OR_URL
and switch between them
SVG upload?
Theres a request issue round auto_discover?

== Performance
