== Images
Transactional removal works?
x Auto_Delete is a mess of attribbutes and settings - test

== Reforms
Must decide resolve the JPEG/Pillow transparency issue
https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2609


== Filters
For cloud, what do you get to make reforms? so what source goes into the filter?
Register, want an instance? Admin want Model?

Get rid of output transparency?
x Stop filters applying effects to fills. (try?)

'Not found' and 'watermark' files on URLs? Makes them static files?

== Admin
After,
 $('#fileinput').prop('files')[0].name;

In options,

    def media(self):

     class Media:
         js = ('image/js/prepopulate.js')

    @property
    def media(self):
        base = super().media
        for jslist in base._js_lists:
            for i, e in enumerate(jslist): 
                if e == 'admin/js/prepopulate.js':
                    del(jslist[i]) 
        return base + Media(js = ('image/js/prepopulate.js',))
