== Filters
For cloud, what do you get to make reforms? so what source goes into the filter?
Register, want an instance? Admin want Model?

x 'Not found' and 'watermark' files on URLs? Makes them static files? !Test

== Admin

== Tags
Can title be part of general tag? No...


== Utils



== Settings
Cache filefinding, and the like


== Forms
Prepopulate in other forms
Not show ''change' file link at all?
Remove file selection from admin ''change', report only?
''Add is fine, uses simple file widget
Similar foreign add is fine, simple widget
What it needs to do is save the new image, the go on to create the model into which it is embedded.

== Widget
Since when was Mozilla file browser D&D?
- How to test?
Some of the hover drop effects not working, why?

but ''change' is the horrible mess of ''choose' and ''add'
Try test for writability of ''files'


= Tests
For filter format (size)?


= General
STATIC_OR_URL
and switch between them
SVG upload?
Theres a request issue round auto_discover?

== Performance
