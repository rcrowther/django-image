= Structure
How does cloud storage generate reforms?
Images Admin not removing files (do last)
Does auto delete work? (Partly)
auto_delete tests
Django is checking filename length

== Model
Unique titles? get rid of pks. Good? Good for searches.


== Management
Work on pks too
Image sync 
View file wrong after sync
http://localhost:8000/media/srv/soundsense/media/originals/03.09.12_smilejam_purple_3_2.png
/media/srv/soundsense spurious
Yet it deletes a file?

== Images
Transactional removal works?


== Reforms
Conclude the JPEG/Pillow transparency issue
https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2609


== Filters
For cloud, what do you get to make reforms? so what source goes into the filter?
Register, want an instance? Admin want Model?

Get rid of output transparency?
x Stop filters applying effects to fills. (try?)

x 'Not found' and 'watermark' files on URLs? Makes them static files? !Test

== Admin

== Tags
Can title be part of general tag? No...


== Utils



== Settings
Cache filefinding, and the like


== Forms
Prepopulate in other forms

= Tests

= General
STATIC_OR_URL
and switch between them
SVG upload?
Theres a request issue round auto_discover?
Get rid of checks. Django does them.

== Performance
