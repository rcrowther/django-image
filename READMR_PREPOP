The prepopulate code is somethig Django users sometimes ask about. The standard Django.form prepopulate() will not work away from slug fields, especially for widgets as complex as a File browser. But it works here? Because it uses a Javascript modification of the Django Admin code. So to use it in your own Admin, you need to add a Media class, and declare model fields as SingleImage.
