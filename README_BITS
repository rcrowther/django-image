#### Autodeletion
##### Overview
Sadly, it is impossible to auto-delete an image if the carrying model is removed.

Isn't this what CASCADE is for, you say? Yes, but cascade deletes the model carrying the foreign key. In our terms, it will remove a model if the image is removed (not usually the action you want).

Well, then, you say, what about Django signals? But we allow freeform renaming of inherited models. Signal handlers need to be registered. Do we register every new subclass of Image?

Use a general handler, you press, use post_delete and check the models. Not good. Signal handlers are expensive. Signal code should be small and light. Checking every post_delete to test if it is an Image derivative is possible, but not good.

Ok, you say, override the model delete() method! That works for sure. But the issue is that it won't work on bulk deletes. [Bulk deletes bypass the delete method]{https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/} (though they do emit signals).

You insist, model.delete() has a keep_parent parameter, that will do it! No, it won't, that parameeter has nothing to do with table relationships, it's for model inheritance.

Of these messy solutions, I prefer the targetted signals solution. It's unecessary code (the data and structures are there already), but it is stock Django and the action we would like.

## Parts available
The prebuilt packages above rely on several pieces of code, which you can use yourself. But using them yourself may involve some thought. 


So integrating one part of the functionality of these packages may not be as easy as you think. If you want to do that, go look in admins.py, where the code is gathered and heavily commented.

Images are made available in admin. Reforms are not (they autogenerate from template tags, autodelete their files, and are generally regarded as automatic).

Images are mainly intended to be attached to other models. So the admin display is only intended for dev and maintencence. Therefore the displays are basic, and will not display images, to speed lookups and save visual space.

The model admin forms have prepopulate code for titles. If you don't want that, comment out the prepopulate attribute, and preferably the media property declaration.

# Other usages
 but for resons of ecomomy, Django doesn't automatically use full clean.. This to thoroughtly check the slug in a 

 So maybe a DetailView,

    class ArticleDetailView(DetailView):
        model = Article
        context_object_name = 'article'
        
Then, it's a waste of the Wagtail setup, but you can summon the original in a template  as simply as,

        {{ article.img.img_tag }}
        <caption>{{ article.img,title }}</caption>


##############
I think the best way to say this is that this app not intended to be 'powerful'. 

The app is designed for images, so of limited use for other documents and media. It won't be useful for a large number of images, for that you will need to abandon use of Django admin. It is limited for use with a small numbers of images, because you may want more help with image previews and gallery handling. It can not be used to offer users image processing options.

# Full notes

With the image app you do most of your work in the app which uses the images, not the app itself.

<div style="background-color=pink; border:1px solid red;"><
*Warning*: This app does not let you write filters with parameters other than a filter name into templates.
/div>

You write a filter, then reference it in templates. It's easier this way, and why would you write variable into templates any more than you would hard-set inline CSS? I tell you this now, in case this app, in it's basic state, is not for you.




This works for me---inside an app called Page I can have a file of filters e.g. Large/Medium/Small, made for Page styling. Inside an app called BlogPost, I can place another set of filters Medium/Small/Thumb, made for BlogPost styling.

Put this in an 'image_filters.py' file somewhere,

   from image import filters

   class Large(filters.SmartResize):
        width=382
        height=256
        # optional. By default, 'white'
        background_colour="#34578"
        # optional. By default, the format of the source.
        iformat='png'
