# Django-images
A drop and go app (as much as a Django app can be) to handle upload and display of images in Django.

The base code is concise and levers Django recommentions and facilities where possible. It may form a good base for others wishing to build their own app.

The front end, by which I mean 'programmer API' is designed for a particular purpose (most image apps are). It is for webistes where images are associated with other models. Use cases might include websites of local interest, such as small-scale publishing and shops. These examples would associate images with other models, for example, SalesItem or Article.


## Why you may not want this app
This may not be the app for you.

The app API does not let you write template tags with adjustable parameters, filters with runtime parameter processing, create filter chains, or categorise/tag images.

All these facilities can be built in to the base code. But then the app wil not be, for you, a plug and go solution.
 
The code API is a step back from the facilities mentioned above. It is small, concise, and fits good CSS/template-practice. 


Also, I have not,
- considered SVG images
- tested cloud storage


## Overview
Images are tracked in the database. The base model is called 'Image'. 

Each original image can generate derivitive images. These are tracked by a model called 'Reform'. Reforms are generated by filters. Filters can be defined in apps or centrally. 

Image delivery is by template tag. The presence of a tag with a reference to an image and a filter will generate a reform automatically. The tags deliver images by URL.

File-based storage is in 'media/' with paths adjustable through attribute settings.

The app includes code to upload images. The Django admin for the base application has some (optional) customisation.



## If you have done this before
- Decide if you want to use the core collection. If you want an app-based collection, [subclass the models for Image and Reform](#new-image-repositories).

- [Add fields](#model-fields) to models that need them.

- [Add auto deletion](#Autodeletion) if you want models carrying image fields to delete images automatically.

- Migrate new tables.

- Create 'image_filters.py' files in the apps, then [Sublass a few filters](#filters),

- Insert [template tags](#template-tags) into the relevant templates.



## Quickstart
### Depemdancies
Unidecode,

    pip unidecode

[Unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/)

Pillow,

    pip pillow

[Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)


#### Optional
To use Wand filters, on Debian-based distros,

    sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev

Then,

    pip install wand





### Install
Download the app code to Django

Declare in Django settings,

        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'image.apps.ImageConfig',
            ...
        ]

migrate now,

    ./manage.py makemigrations image
    ./manage.py migrate image

If you have Django Admin, you can now upload images.



### Upload some images
In Django admin, go to Image upload and try upload a few images.

I don't know about you, but if I have a new app I like to try with real data. If you have a collection of test images somewhere, try this management command,

    ./manage.py image_create_bulk pathToMyDirectory

You can create, meaning upload and register, fifteen or twenty images in a few seconds.



### View some images
Ok, let's see an image. Two ways.

#### Use a view 
Find a web view template. Nearly any template will do (maybe not a JSON REST interface, something visible).

Add this tag to the template,

    {% load img_tags %}
    ...
    {% imagequery "pk=1" image.Thumb %}

'image.Thumb' is a predefined filter. It makes a 64x64 pixel thumbnail. The tag we use here searchs for an image by a very low method, "pk=1". This will do for now.  

Visit the page. The app will generate the filtered 'reform' image automatically.


#### Don't have a view?
Yeh, new or experimental site, I know. Image has a builtin view. Goto urls.py, add this,

    path('image/<int:pk>/', ImageDetailView.as_view(), name='image-detail'),

Now visit (probably) http://localhost:8000/image/1/ To see some *real* web code.

### (optional) See a broken image
USe the management command to remove reforms,

    .manage.py reform_delete

Goto '/media/originals' and delete the file (the file you are currently viewing as a reform).

Now refresh the view. The app will try to find the reform. When it fails, it will attempt to make a new one. But because the original file is missing, it will fail to do that too, so display a generic 'broken' image.
 
### (aside) Filters
Perhaps your first request will be how to make a new filter.

Make a new file called 'image filters'. Put it in the top level of any app (not in the site directory, that can be done but must be configured in a [settings.py](#settings). Put something in like this (adapt if you wish),

    from image import Resize, registry

    class MediumImage(Resize)
        width=260
        height=350
        format='png'

    registry.register(MediumImage)
 
Now adapt the template tag (or the tag in image/templates/image/image_detail.html) to point at the new filter,

    {% imagequery "pk=1" someAppName.MediumImage %}

Visit the page again. Image sees the new filter definition, then generates a new reform (filters the image), then displays it.

Ok, you changed the image size, and maybe the format. If you want to continue, you probably have questions. Goto the main documentation.



## QuickStop
Don't like what you see?

- Remove any temporary code.
- Migrate backwards ('./manage.py migrate image zero')
- Remove from apps.py
- Remove the two directories '/media/originals/', '/media/reforms/'
- Remove the app folder.

That's it, gone.

## Model Fields
Two ways,

#### The ImageRelationFieldMixin model fields
There are two, ImageManyToOneField and ImageOneToOneField,

    from image.model_fields import ImageManyToOneField


    class Page(models.Model):

        img = ImageManyToOneField(
            'page.Image'
            )


##### Auto-delete images
For ImageRelationFieldMixin fields, associated images (and their reforms and files) can be auto-deleted with the model. See [Auto Delete](#auto-delete) 


#### Stock Django declaration,
You can also use a stock Django foreign key declaration,

    from image.models import Image


    class Page(models.Model):

        img = models.ForeignKey(
            'page.Image',
            null=True,
            blank=True,
            on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
            related_name='+'
            )

         etc.

null=True and blank=True means users can delay adding an image until later. And related_name='*' means that Images will not track the models you are creating. See Django documentation of model fields for more details.

Only use models.CASCADE if you are sure this is what you want. It means, if an image is deleted, the model that carries the image is deleted too. This is not usually what you want.


#### Choosing between the two
ImageOneToOneField/ImageManyToOneField
- tidy
- Work with preconfigured admin and auto-delete

Foreign Field
- Django stock
- explicit
- flexible configuration


## New Image Repositories
### Overview
The core models in this app can be subclassed. If you create subclasses, the subclass models have new DB tables, and can operate with new configurations such as storing files in different directories.

Two scenarios where you may want to do this,

#### Associated data with images
You may want to associate data with an image. Many people's first thought would be to add a title. That said, an image title is not often displayed, and/or a simple duplication of a filename, which should be avoided. This app does not provide titles by default.

But other kinds of information can be attached such as captions, credits, dates, and/or data for semantic rendering. All of these may be viewed as 'an aspect of the image'.

#### Splitting needs
It's fun to tweak with settings, but sometimes, maybe often, this is not the best approach.

Let's say you have a website which gathers photos that are joined to NewsArticle. Those photos are linked for sure to the Article, and can probably be created and deleted with the NewsArticle. But you may also have a need to upload images for the site in general, perhaps for banner displays. This is an image pool. The deletion policy is different. There may be no need for credits.
 
These are two seperate apps. Make two apps. Avoid complex configuration.

### Subclassing Image/Reform 
Here is a minimal subclass. In the models.py file in an app, do this,

    from image.models import AbstractImage, AbstractReform

    class NewsArticleImage(AbstractImage):
        reform_model = 'NewsArticleReform'
        upload_dir='news_originals'

        # AbstractImage has a file and upload_date
        caption = models.CharField(_('Caption'),
            max_length=255,
        )

        author = models.CharField(_('Author'),
            max_length=255,
            db_index=True
        )

        etc.



    class NewsArticleReform(AbstractReform):
        image_model = NewsArticleImage
        upload_dir='news_reforms'

        # exactly the same in every subclass
        image = models.ForeignKey(image_model, related_name='+', on_delete=models.CASCADE)


Not the last word in DRY coding, but you should be able to work out what the code is for. Note that 'image_model' and 'reform_model' are explicitly declared, and that the 'reform_model' is declared as a string, but the 'image_model' is declared as a class.

Migrate,

    ./manage.py makemigrations NewsArticle
    ./manage.py migrate NewsArticle

You now have a new image upload app. It has it's own DB tables. Change it's configuration (see next section). Refer to it in other models,

    class NewsArticle(models.Model):

        img = ImageManyToOneField(
            "news_article.NewssArticleImage"
            )

        etc.

### Attributes
Subclasses accept some attributes. Here is an expanded version of the above,

    from image.models import AbstractImage, AbstractReform

    class NewsArticleImage(AbstractImage):
        reform_model = 'NewsArticleReform'
        upload_dir='news_originals'
        accept_formats = ['png']
        filepath_length=55
        max_upload_size=2
        form_limit_filepath_length=True
        auto_delete_files=True

        etc.



    class NewsArticleReform(AbstractReform):
        image_model = NewsArticleImage
        upload_dir='news_reforms'
        file_format='png'
        jpeg_quality=28

        # exactly the same in every subclass
        image = models.ForeignKey(image_model, related_name='+', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

Some of these attributes introduce checks ('max_upload_size'), some set defaults('file_format'), some can be overriden ('file_format', 'jpeg_quality' can be overriden by filter settings). See [Settings](#settings) for details.


### Inheritance! Can I build repositories using OOP techniques?
No! Python has been cautous about this kind of programming, and Django's solutions are a workround. Try stacking models of any kind and, unless you know the code line by line,  the classes will create unusable migrations. For stability and maintainability, create models directly from the abstract bases.


### Things to consider when subclassing models
#### Auto delete of files
May be a good idea to set up your deletion policy from the start. See [Auto Delete](#auto-delete)
 
#### Add Meta information
You may want to configure a Meta class. If you added titles or slugs, for example, you may be interested in making them into unique constrained groups, or adding indexes,

    class NewssArticleImage(AbstractImage):
        upload_dir='news_originals'
        filepath_length=100

        etc.

        class Meta:
            verbose_name = _('news_image')
            verbose_name_plural = _('news_images')
            indexes = [
                models.Index(fields=['author']),
            ]
            constraints = [
                models.UniqueConstraint(
                    fields=['title', 'author'], 
                    name='unique_newsarticle_reform_src'
                )


## Auto-delete
### Overview
I read somewhere that a long time ago, Django would auto-delete files. This probably happened in model fields. This is not true now. If objects and fields are deleted, files are left in the host system. However, it suits this application, and some of it's intended uses, to auto-delete models and files. If you would like this behaviour, the app provides some solutions.

There are aspects to this. First, automatic removal of images when a supporting model is deleted. Then, automatic removal of reform objects when the original image object is deleted. Finally, automatic deletion of files, Image or Reform, when an object is deleted.


### Automatic deletion of images when a supporting object is deleted
Place this in the ready() method of the application,

    from image.signals import register_image_delete_handler


    class NewsConfig(AppConfig):
        ...

        def ready(self):
            super().ready()
            from news_article.models import NewsArticle
            register_image_delete_handler(NewsArticle)

The image fields must be ImageOneToOneFields, and the field attribute must be 'auto_delete=True'.

#### Why must the code run on the custom field and not on a ImageOneToManyField?
The custom field means lightweight field identification.
 
An ImageOneToManyField implies an image pool. Many connections to one image. This is a  classic computing problem of reference counting. Best avoided.
 
  
### Automatic deletion of reform objects
Reforms are treated as objects generated automatically, so automatic deletion is not controversial. Moreover, the main template tag acesses reforms through the Image model, so will not work if the original image is removed. 

The core application removes reforms by default. So will custom repositories, as long as the 'image' foreign key is set to CASCADE.


### Automatic deletion of files
The application provides a signals solution. There is no way to 'inherit' the behaviour. It must be implemented for each image repository.

#### Auto-delete Reform files
Place this in the ready() method of the application,

    from image.signals import register_file_delete_handlers
b

    class NewsConfig(AppConfig):
        ...

        def ready(self):
            super().ready()
            from news_article.models import NewsArticleReform
            register_reform_delete_handler(NewsArticleReform)



#### Auto-delete Image and Reform files
Place this in the ready() method of the application,

    from image.signals import register_file_delete_handlers


    class NewsConfig(AppConfig):
        ...

        def ready(self):
            super().ready()
            from news_article.models import NewsArticleImage, NewsArticleReform
            register_file_delete_handler(NewsArticleImage, NewsArticleReform)

The Image class attribute must be 'auto_delete=True'. 


### Default behavior
By default, the core repository will auto-delete Reform models when the Image is deleted, and auto-delete the associated files. It will not auto-delete the original files associated with Images. This behaviour is not interited by custom repositories. 



## Filters
### Overview
Filters are used to describe how an original uploaded image should be modified for display. In the background, the app will automatically adjust the image to the given spacification (or use a cached version).
 
A few filters are predefined. A couple of utility filters,

<dl>
<dt>Format</dt>
    <dd>Change the format of an uploaded image
<dt>Thumb</dt>
    <dd>A 64x64 pixel square</dd>
</dl>

And some base filters, which you can configure. These are all centre-anchored, 

- Crop
- Resize
- SmartCrop
- SmartResize

If you only need different image sizes, then you only need to configure these. But if you want to pass some time with image-processing code, you can add filters to generate ''PuddingColour' and other effects.


### Filter placement and registration
Files of filter definitions can be placed in any app. Start a file called 'image_filters.py' and off you go.

If you would prefer to gether all filters together in one place, define the settings to include,

    IMAGES = [
        {
            'SEARCH_MODULES': [
                        "siteName",
            ],
        },
    ]

Then put a file image_filters.py in the 'sitename' directory. If you use a central file, you should namespace the filters,

    BlogPostLarge:
        width : 256
        height 256


### Filter declarations
All builtin filter bases accept these attributes,

- width
- height
- format

Most filter code demands 'width' and 'height', but 'format' is optional. Without a stated format, the image format stays as it was (unless another setting is in place). Formats accepted are conservative,

    bmp, gif, ico, jpg, png, rgb, tiff, webp 

which should be written as above (lowercase, and 'jpg', not 'jpeg'). So,

    from image import Resize, registry

    class MediumImage(Resize)
        width=260
        height=350
        format='png'

    registry.register(MediumImage)


Crop and Resize can/often result in images narrower in one dimension. 

The Smart filters do a background fill in a chosen colour, so return the requaeted size,

    from image import ResizeSmart, registry

    class MediumImage(ResizeSmart):
        width=260
        height=350
        format='jpg'
        fill_color="Coral"

    registry.register(MediumImage)

Fill color is defined however the image library handles it. Both Pillow and Wand can handle CSS style hex e.g. '#00FF00' (green), and HTML colour-names e.g. 'AliceWhite'.


### Registering filters
Filters need to be registered. Registration style is like ModelAdmin, templates etc. Registration is to the image.registry (this is how templatetags finds them).

You can use an explicit declaration,

    from image import ResizeSmart, registry

    ...

    registry.register(single_or_list_of_filters)

OR use the decorator,

    from image import register, ResizeSmart

    @register()
    class MediumImage(ResizeSmart):
        width=260
        height=350
        format='jpg'
        fill_color="Coral"


### Wand filters
The base filters in the Wand filter set have more attributes available. The 'wand' code needs Wand to be installed on the host computer. Assuming that, you gain these effects,

    from image import registry
    from image.wand_filters import ResizeSmart

    class MediumImage(ResizeSmart):
        width=260
        height=350
        format='jpg'
        pop=False
        greyscale=False
        night=False
        warm=False
        strong=False
        no=False
        watermark=None # e.g.'/srv/images/watermark.png'

    registry.register(Medium)


If you enable more than one effect, they will chain, though you have no control over order.

I lost my way with the Wand effects. There is no 'blur', no 'rotate', no 'waves'. But there is,

<dl>
    <dt>pop</dt>
    <dd>
        Tightens leveling of black and white
    </dd>
    <dt>greyscale</dt>
    <dd>
        A fast imitation
    </dd>
    <dt>night</dt>
    <dd>
        Pretend the picture is from a movie
    </dd>
    <dt>warm</dt>
    <dd>
        A small shift in hue to compensate for a common photography white-balance issue. 
    </dd>
    <dt>strong</dt>
    <dd>
        Oversaturate image colors (like everyone does on the web). Unlike 'pop' this will not stress contrast so flatten blacks and whites. You may or may not prefer this. 
    </dd>
    <dt>no</dt>
    <dd>
        Draw a red cross across the image
    </dd>
    <dt>watermark</dt>
    <dd>Accepts a URL to a watermark image template.
    </dd>
</dl>

Watermark deserves some explanation. This does not draw on the image, as text metrics are tricky to handle. You configure a URL stub to an image, here's a builtin,

    watermark = 'image/watermark.png'

The URL is Django static-aware, but will pass untouched if you give it a web URL (like the URLs in Django Media).
 
The template is scaled to the image-to-be-watermarked, then composited over the main image by 'dissolve'. So the watermark is customisable, can be used on most sizes of image, and is usually readable since aspect ratio is preserved.

It is probably worth saying again that you can not change the parameters, so the strengths of these effects, without creating a new filter.


### Writing custom filter code
First bear in mind that Image uses fixed parameters. So your filter must work with fixed parameters across a broad range of uploaded images. I don't want anyone to dive into code, put in hours of work, then ask me how they can create an online image-editing app. Not going to happen.

However, while I can't make a case for 'waves' or 'pudding-colour' filters, I can see uses. For example, Wagtail CMS uses the OpenCV library to generate images that auto-focus on facial imagry (i.e. not centrally crop). There are uses for that.

Second, bear in mind that image editing is lunging into another world, rather like creating Django forms without using models and classes. It will take time. But there is help available.
 
Inherit from image.Filter. You will need to provide a 'process' method, which takes an open Python File and returns a ByteBufferIO and a file extension.

If you want the filter to work with the Pillow or Wand liraries, you can inherit from the PillowMixin or WandMixin. These cover filehandling for those libraries. so you can provide a 'modify' method, which alters then returns an image in the format of those libraries.

See the code for details.


### Why can filters not be chained or given parameters?
This app only enables creation of fixed filters intended for a broad range of images. You write a filter with parameters, the processing order is fixed, and it is set.

This is a deliberate decision. It makes life easy. If you want to produce a front-end that can adjust the filters, or chain them, that is another step. This is not that app.






## Admin
### Overview
Image ships with stock Django admin. However, this is not always suited to the app, it's intended or possible uses. So there are some additions.

The admin provided has an attitude about how to use the app. It assumes that each model instance is locked to one file. If a model exists, then the file exists. If the admin is given the same file, it duplicates the file and model.

In this system, models that refer to Image models can be null and blank, which represents 'image not yet uploaded'. And it is possible to build systems that reuse images. It is the Image_instance->file connection that is locked.


### Package solutions
#### ImageCoreAdmin
For administration and maintenance of the image collections. This is a rather specialised use, which would only be visible to end users if they are trusted.

This is built into the image app, and can be used on custom repositories too.

Significant changes,

- changelist is tidier and includes 'view' and 'delete' links
- changelist has searchable filenames
- change form has 'readonly' file data


##### Remove ImageCoreAdmin from central repository
Want Django stock admin (or a custom)? Change the comments in 'image/admin.py' from,

    # Custom admin interface disalows deletion of files from models.
    class ImageAdmin(ImageCoreAdmin):
        
    # Stock admin interface.
    #class ImageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        pass
            
            
    admin.site.register(Image, ImageAdmin)

to,

    # Custom admin interface disalows deletion of files from models.
    #class ImageAdmin(ImageCoreAdmin):
        
    # Stock admin interface.
    class ImageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        pass
        
        
    admin.site.register(Image, ImageAdmin)



##### Notes and alternatives for the core admin
You may provide no core admin at all. You can use the ./manage.py commands to do maintenence. The stock admin is provided to get you started.

If you prefer your own core admin, have a look at the code for ImageCoreAdmin in '/image/admins.py'. It provides some useful clues about how to do formfield overrides and other customisations.

If using subclassed Image/Reform models, you may find it more maintainable to duplicate and modify the admin code, rather than import and override.


#### LinkedImageAdmin
For administration of models that contain foreign key links to images.

This is a small override that should not interfere with other admin code. It disallows image editing once an image has been connected to a field (by upload or selection). e.g.

    from image.addmins import LinkedImageAdmin

        class NewsArticleAdmin(LinkedImageAdmin, admin.ModelAdmin):
            pass
            
            
        admin.site.register(NewsArticle, NewsArticleAdmin)



## Forms
### Overview
There's nothing special about using images trom this app in forms. Even the custom fields are mostly renames to tidy code and namespace custom admin configurations.

That said, the fields used by Image for image storage are not standard Django. 

### ImageFileField
If you are interested in the internals, this does a few extra jobs beyond an ImageFile,

<dl>
    <dt>Contains extra config attributes,</dt>
    <dd>Most of which are gathered from the class configuration (e.g. max_upload size). The class cas deconstruct these for migrations.</dd>
    <dt>extra validators<ddt>
    <dd>Beyond the standard Django field, this field and it's formfield actively check filesizes and extansions. Calls to is_valid() will run these validations.</dd>
</dl>

### For references to images
When images are referenced from another model, this would usually [use a Foreign Key on the referring model](#model-fields). 


## Template Tags
### Overview
For most uses, the app only has one template tag. There is another, for testing and edge cases.

### The 'image' tag
Let's say there is a filter named ''Large'. Add this to template code,

    {% load img_tags %}

    {% image report.img my_app.Large %}
 
then visit the page. The app will generate a ''Large' reform of 'report.image', to the spec given in the filter.

The tag can guess the app from the context. So,

     {% image report.img Large %}

Will assume the filter is in the app the context says the view comes from.

The tag accepts keyword parameters which become HTML attributes,

     {% image report.img Large class="report-image" %}

This renders similar to,

    <img src="/media/reforms/eoy-report_large.png" alt="eoy-report image" class="report-image">


### The 'query' tag
There is a tag to find images by a database query. Sometimes this will be useful, for fixed or temporary decoration/banners etc. It must be given the app/model path in full,

        {{ imagequery some_app_name.some_image_model_name "some_query" image.Large  }}

e.g.

        {{ imagequery image.Image "pk=1" image.Large  }}

or,

        {{ imagequery "src="taunton-skyscraper"" image.Large  }}

While this may be useful, especially for fixed logos or banners, it is unnecessary if you are passing a model through a context. 


### Filters from other apps
You can borrow filter collections from other apps. Use the module path and filter classname,

    {% image "urban_decay" different_app.filter_name  %} 

But try not to create a tangle between your apps. You would not do that with CSS or other similar resources. Store general filters in a central location, and namespace them.



## Management Commands
They are,

- image_create_bulk
- image_sync
- image_list
- reform_delete

All management commands can be pointed at subclasses of Image and Reform, as well as the default app models.

They do what they say. 'image_sync' is particularly useful, it will attempt to make models for orphaned files, or delete orphaned files, or delete models with missing files. These commands are useful for dev, too.





## Settings
### Overview
Image accepts settings in several places. The app has moved away from site-wide settings towards other placements. Here is a summary, in order of last placement wins,

### Image
<dl>
    <dt>reform_model</dt>
    <dd>
        default=AbstractReform
    </dd>
    <dt>upload_dir</dt>
    <dd>
        default='originals', Image attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>filepath_length</dt>
    <dd>
        default=100, Image attribute
      </dd>
    <dt>form_limit_filepath_length</dt>
    <dd>
        default=True, Image attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>accept_formats</dt>
    <dd>
        default=None, Image attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>max_upload_size</dt>
    <dd>
        default=2MB, Image attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>auto_delete_files</dt>
    <dd>
        (if enabled) Image/Reform attribute
    </dd>
</dl>

### Reform
<dl>
    <dt>upload_dir</dt>
    <dd>
        default='reforms', Reform attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>image_model</dt>
    <dd>
        default='image.Image', Reform attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>file_format</dt>
    <dd>
        (set thee default format of reforms) default=original format, Reform attribute, filter attribute
    </dd>
    <dt>jpeg_quality</dt>
    <dd>
        (set the quality of JPEG reforms) default=80, Reform attribute, filter attribute
    </dd>
</dl>


### Site-wide settings
Images accepts some site-wide settings,

    IMAGES = [
        {
            'SEARCH_APP_DIRS': True,
            'SEARCH_MODULES': [
                        "someSiteName",
            ],
        },
    ]

<dl>
    <dt>BROKEN</dt>
    <dd>
    URL of a static file displayed in place of ureadable files. Takes a static-aware URL to a file. URLs with a web-based scheme pass untouched, relative URLs are assumed in the app's static folder. Default is 'image/unfound.png'.
    </dd>
    <dt>SEARCH_APP_DIRS</dt>
    <dd>
    Find 'image_filters.py' files in apps. If False, the app only uses filters defined in the core app and SEARCH_MODULES setting.
    </dd>
    <dt>SEARCH_MODULES</dt>
    <dd>
    Defines extra places to find 'image_filter.py' files. The above example suggests a site-wide filter collection in the site directory (most page-based Django sites have central collections of templates and CSS in the same directory). The setting takes module paths, not filepaths, because 'image_filter.py' files are live code.
    </dd>
</dl>



## Broken Images
The app throws a special error if images are broken i.e. files are missing or unreadable. In this case a stock 'broken' image is returned, Using the standard tags there is no need to configure or change in any way for this. The image can be [redefined]{#settings}.


    
        
## Utilities
### The View
Image has a builtin view. It's main purpose is to test filter code. The view template reforms from images in the core repository. As a test and trial device, it is not enabled by default.

Goto urls.py, add this,

    path('image/<int:pk>/', ImageDetailView.as_view(), name='image-detail'),

Now visit (probably),

    http://localhost:8000/image/1/

The template is at,

    image/templates/image/image_detail.html

Where you can edit the template tag to point at your own configurations. With visible results and basic image data, it is a lot easier to use than the shell.



## Notes
No SVG support 
: would require shadow code, Pillow especially can't handle them

Widths, heights and bytesize of original images are recorded, in case the storage media is not local files but cloud provision.

The app generally uses URLs, not the filepaths. This can be confusing, but it means it is 'static' aware, and it should keep working if you swap storage backends.


## Credits
The upload and storage code (particularly the replicable models) are ripped from the Wagtail CMS. Though I am responsibile for what has happened after that.
